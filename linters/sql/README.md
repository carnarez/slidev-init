**SQL linter/checker helper tool.** Run `make env` to get everything set up (in
`~/.local/bin`). Several checkers/formatters/linters included (still haven't elected any
favourite):

* [`pglast`](https://github.com/lelit/pglast)
* [`sqlfluff`](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff)
* [`sqlparse`](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse)

Users and groups are mounted (read-only) from the host system to avoid ownership issues.
